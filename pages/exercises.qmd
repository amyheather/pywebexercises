## Front matter

To include MCQ in our quarto site, we first need to include the following in the front matter of our `.qmd` file:

```
format: 
  html:
    css: [../assets/webex.css]
    include-after-body: [../assets/webex.js]
    embed-resources: true 
```

We then import the `mcq()` and `longmqc()` functions.

```{python}
from pywebexercises.exercises import mcq, longmcq, torf
```

When using these functions, set `#| echo: false` to prevent the code from showing in your document.

## MCQ

The `mcq()` function will produce a drop-down box.

:::{.callout-note}

## How many legs does a spider have?

```{python}
#| echo: false
mcq({
    '1': 0,
    '3': 0,
    '8': 1,
    '200': 0
})
```

:::

This was generated by running:

```{python}
#| eval: false
mcq({
    '1': 0,
    '3': 0,
    '8': 1,
    '200': 0
})
```

## LongMCQ

The `longmcq()` function will produce radio buttons.

:::{.callout-note}

## How many legs does a spider have?

```{python}
#| echo: false
longmcq({
    '1': 0,
    '3': 0,
    '8': 1,
    '200': 0
})
```

:::

This was generated by running:

```{python}
#| eval: false
longmcq({
    '1': 0,
    '3': 0,
    '8': 1,
    '200': 0
})
```

## True or false

The `torf()` function can be used to create a drop-down with options of True or False.

:::{.callout-note}

## We live on the planet Mars.

```{python}
#| echo: false
torf(False)
```

:::

That was generated by running:

```{python}
#| eval: false
torf(False)
```

## Checked sections

These are created by making a `webex-check` section, which will add a button that will only display feedback when pressed.

You can also include `.webex-box` to draw a box around the section.

```
:::{.webex-check .webex-box}

# Question/s here

:::
```

For example:

:::{.webex-check .webex-box}

What is a baby dog called?

```{python}
#| echo: false
longmcq({
    'kitten': 0,
    'puppy': 1
})
```

What is a baby sheep called?

```{python}
#| echo: false
longmcq({
    'lamb': 1,
    'calf': 0
})
```
