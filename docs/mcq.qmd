## Front matter

To include MCQ in our quarto site, we first need to include the following in the front matter of our `.qmd` file:

```
format: 
  html:
    css: [../assets/webex.css]
    include-after-body: [../assets/webex.js]
    embed-resources: true 
```

We then import the `mcq()` and `longmqc()` functions.

```{python}
from pywebexercises.exercises import mcq, longmcq
```

When using these functions, set `echo = FALSE` to prevent the code from showing in your document. On this page, it has been included to show how the questions were generated.

## MCQ

The `mcq()` function will produce a drop-down box.

:::{.callout-note}

## How many legs does a spider have?

```{python}
#| echo: false
mcq({
    '1': 0,
    '3': 0,
    '8': 1,
    '200': 0
})
```

:::

This was generated by running:

```{python}
#| eval: false
mcq({
    '1': 0,
    '3': 0,
    '8': 1,
    '200': 0
})
```

## LongMCQ

The `longmcq()` function will produce radio buttons.

:::{.callout-note}

## How many legs does a spider have?

```{python}
#| echo: false
longmcq({
    '1': 0,
    '3': 0,
    '8': 1,
    '200': 0
})
```

This was generated by running:

```{python}
#| eval: false
longmcq({
    '1': 0,
    '3': 0,
    '8': 1,
    '200': 0
})
```
